Defence

You have a complete defence against proceedings for an alleged infringement offence if the infringement fee has been paid to [name of enforcement authority] in the manner specified in this notice before, or within 28 days after, you are served with a reminder notice in respect of the alleged offence.

deny liability for the alleged offence and request a court hearing; or

Note: The court is entitled to take into account any maximum fine for the offence, not just the infringement fee. In that case, the court may impose a fine that is greater than the infringement fee (but you still cannot get a conviction). Also, costs will be imposed in addition to any penalty.
